# music-playlist-export-import

Export playlist from one web source and import them to YouTube Music. The initial version scrapes a playlist from the BBC website and uses the [unofficial YouTube Music API](https://ytmusicapi.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) to import the playlist into YouTube Music. That documenation describes how to connect your Python script to YouTube Music and install the API on your computer.
